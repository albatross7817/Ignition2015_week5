#### Deliverables for week 5 Rails MVC
##### Odin Project Routing Guide Questions:
- What is the "Root" route?<br\>The "Root" route is an instruction inside the 'config/routes.rb' file which lets Rails know how and where to set up the application when it is used. It typically takes the form of a URL (Uniform Rersource Locator) that specifies a controller and action for Rails to map the route to. The 'root' route is the simplest and most important route in the 'routes.rb' file because it defines a starting point for the application once it is in use.<br\><br\>
- What are the seven RESTful routes for a resource?<br\>The seven RESTful routes for a resource are (i) GET all the posts ("index" the posts); (ii) GET just one specific post ("show" one specific post); (iii) GET the page to create a new post (view the "new" post page); (iv) POST inputted data back to the server ("create" the post); (v) GET the page to edit an existing post (view the "edit" post page); (vi) PUT the inputted edit data back to the server so it can be updated ("update" the post); and (vii) DELETE a specific post ("destroy" the post).<br\><br\>
